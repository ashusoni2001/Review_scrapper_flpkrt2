Product Name Not Available,Flipkart Customer,4, Very good product. The various angles of incline help me to keep my laptop and books and read them conveniently. The material is sturdy and quite strong and can support good amount of weight. The design also does not let the computer slip in any direction. The only drawback is that the width is not as advertised. It is way smaller when compared to my 16" laptop. That was a bit disappointing. Also, the side stand is not useful for mobile phones. I think it is meant for tabs.READ MORE
